# Approaching AGI  
## A Personal Reflection Inspired by Qubic, Neuraxon, and AIGARTH

---

## Status

This document is a **personal analytical reflection**.  
It does **not** claim that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has been achieved.

Its purpose is to explore **how one may realistically approach AGI**,  
by focusing on architectural foundations rather than shortcuts,  
inspired by the work around **Qubic**, **Neuraxon**, and **AIGARTH**.

This is **not** an official Qubic document.

## Introduction

For several years, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has been widely discussed.  
Often too much.  
And often incorrectly.

Performance is confused with intelligence,  
speed with understanding,  
and data scale with cognitive maturity.

Yet, when observing the real evolution of artificial intelligence systems,  
one fact becomes increasingly clear:  
**scaling models is not enough**.

AGI is not primarily a question of size.  
It is about **how an intelligence exists, learns, and evolves over time**.

This reflection is built from that premise,  
and from observing the architectural direction taken by **Qubic**,  
particularly through **Neuraxon** and **AIGARTH**.

## The Core Limitation of Current AI

Modern AI systems are impressive.  
They speak fluently, reason quickly, and answer almost anything.

However, they share a fundamental weakness:  
**they lack true continuity**.

They learn in phases.  
They forget.  
They can repeat the same errors indefinitely.

If an AI is wrong today,  
there is no guarantee it will not be wrong again tomorrow in the same way.

In other words:  
they compute extremely well, but **they do not mature**.

Even an imperfect form of general intelligence should at least:
- remember its mistakes,
- integrate consequences,
- evolve durably.

---

## Why the Qubic Approach Is Different

Qubic does not take shortcuts.

While it would be easy to integrate a pretrained intelligence  
and quickly obtain impressive results,  
Qubic made a much harder choice:

**working on foundations, not appearances**.

With **Neuraxon**, the goal is not task optimization,  
but the construction of a **cognitive architecture that exists in time**:
- no constant resets,
- continuous internal activity,
- dynamic memory.

With **AIGARTH**, the ambition is not a specialized AI,  
but a **functionally general intelligence**, built progressively.

This path is slow.  
Not spectacular at first.  
But structurally different.

---

## Why Qubic Did Not Load a Pretrained Intelligence

Many wonder why Qubic did not simply integrate an existing model.

The reason is simple:  
**pretrained intelligence brings as many limitations as capabilities**.

It introduces:
- frozen biases,
- inherited errors,
- rigid internal structures.

Most importantly, it prevents something essential:  
**long-term self-correction based on lived experience**.

Qubic chose to start with a more open system,  
capable of transforming itself internally.

Not to move fast at the beginning,  
but to go **much further over time**.

---

## The Role of Oracles: Reconnecting Intelligence to Reality

An intelligence that only interacts through conversation  
remains confined to abstraction.

**Oracles** change this.

They allow the system to:
- observe the world,
- perceive real events,
- detect mismatches between internal models and reality.

The intelligence no longer depends solely on human prompts.  
It observes, compares, and learns.

This is a necessary condition  
for any credible approach to general intelligence.

---

## Why −1 / 0 / +1 Matters

A subtle but fundamental aspect of the Neuraxon approach  
is the use of a **trivalent state system (−1 / 0 / +1)**,  
rather than strict binary logic.

Traditional computing relies on yes/no, on/off logic.  
This is efficient for calculation,  
but limited for cognition that unfolds over time.

In Neuraxon:
- **+1** represents activation,
- **−1** represents active inhibition,
- **0** represents a **functional neutral state**, not absence.

This neutral state allows the system  
to **withhold immediate responses**  
while maintaining internal coherence.

Instead of forcing premature decisions,  
the system can remain stable, observe changes,  
and allow learning to emerge progressively.

This is not a moral or conscious mechanism,  
but a **functional control principle**  
necessary for continuous learning systems.

## The Hardest Question: Why Learn?

At the core of AGI research lies a difficult question:

*What causes an intelligence to learn, self-correct, and seek coherence?*

Qubic, Neuraxon, and AIGARTH do **not** claim to have solved this.

But they have done something rare:  
they built an architecture in which this question becomes **addressable**.

In a system that:
- exists in time,
- remembers,
- is exposed to reality,

errors can create lasting instability,  
and corrections can restore coherence.

Learning becomes less an external command  
and more an internal necessity.

Not human consciousness,  
but a functional step toward durable adaptation.

---

## What Still Remains to Be Built

Being serious about AGI means clearly stating what is still missing.

Despite major advances enabled by Qubic, Neuraxon, and AIGARTH,  
several essential components of general intelligence remain open challenges.

### Learning, but Also Wanting to Learn

The architecture enables learning.  
What remains unresolved is a **stable intrinsic reason to learn**.

A closer approximation to AGI would progress  
not only because it is instructed,  
but because it detects internal inconsistency.

This remains an open research frontier.

---

### Choosing Direction

Today, objectives are still largely externally defined.  
A more general intelligence would need  
to autonomously orient its learning priorities over time.

---

### Stability Over Long Time Horizons

Continuous learning introduces the risk of drift.  
What remains unresolved is deep stability:  
preserving coherence while allowing evolution.

---

### Observing, Understanding… Then Acting

Oracles allow observation.  
Action remains limited  
and must be approached cautiously.

---

## Why Everything Depends on the Beginning

It is often assumed that learning large amounts of knowledge  
is the hardest part of AGI.

In reality, it is the easiest.

Storing information, processing data, and integrating knowledge  
are tasks machines already perform extremely well and extremely fast.

The true difficulty lies in the foundations:
- continuity,
- memory,
- absence of reset,
- durable self-correction.

This is where Qubic concentrated its effort.

Once these foundations exist,  
once the system is truly running,  
learning accelerates naturally.

The machine is fast.  
It does not tire.

After the hardest phase,  
progress can become very rapid.

## Acknowledgements

This reflection would not exist  
without the foundational work around Qubic.

Special thanks to **CFB**  
for the long-term vision, architectural coherence,  
and consistency in pursuing difficult paths rather than quick wins.

Recognition is also due to **José Sanchez** and **David Vivancos**,  
whose work on **Neuraxon** and **AIGARTH** represents a major contribution.

Their research does not aim to impress.  
It aims to understand.  
Not to promise perfection,  
but to build the conditions for intelligence that can evolve over time.

---

## Personal Conclusion

Achieving a perfect AGI may be unrealistic.  
Approaching it honestly is not.

Qubic does not promise the impossible.  
It builds what was missing:  
**time, memory, and real evolution**.

Through **Neuraxon** and **AIGARTH**,  
Qubic chose the hardest path,  
but also the most serious one.

Not a promise.  
A direction.

And in a field as complex as AGI,  
**choosing the right direction is already a major step forward**.
